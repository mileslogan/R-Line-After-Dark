  - Welcome to R Line After Dark!
  - In this game you'll be picking up and dropping off passengers to the music!
  - When you see a person pop up, pick them up with the [Z] key and make sure it's
    in time with the music!
  - Give it a try!
  - Nice now let's practice picking up AND dropping off passengers.
  - To drop off a passenger, press the [X] key when you see an arrow!
  - Wonderful! Now there's actually one more way to drop people off.
  - In drop off express mode, instead of pressing [X], press [WASD] in the direction
    the arrow is located on the track.
  - Alright let's go!
  - Terrific! That's all there is to it! You'll be a fine train driver in no time.
